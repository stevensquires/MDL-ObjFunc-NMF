Code is from this paper:
Squires, Steven, Adam Prugel Bennett, and Mahesan Niranjan. "Minimum description length as an objective function for non-negative matrix factorization." arXiv preprint arXiv:1902.01632 (2019).

The original code was written in MATLAB. There is also a version written in Python, with example scripts to run the method on three datasets.
